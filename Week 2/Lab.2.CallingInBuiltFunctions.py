# The length of the name "Gurveer Mann", if you just count the letters are 11
# However, the space (" ") in between "Gurveer" and "Mann" counts towards the length of the name
# That's why it is shown as 12 and not 11, if you remove the space from the "Enter your information" section
# It will calculate the length of the name as 11 characters and not 12
